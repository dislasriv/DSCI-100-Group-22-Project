    "Doctors and medical professionals around the world deal with and diagnose heart disease daily, in the US it is a leading cause of death, and one of the most significant afflictions worldwide that people spend their entire lives trying to circumvent. Everyone has at some point heard, either from a doctor or a person who has visted one, about the risk factors that lead to heart disease. Most professionals cite things like blood pressure, obesity, blood sugar level, diabetes, blood-cholesterol concentration and other chemical and physical factors that cause heart disease. With this in mind, we will be working with the UC Irvine Heart Disease dataset to answer whether or not we can use a person's resting blood pressure and cholesterol levels to predict whether they will be diagnosed with heart disease or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains fourteen variables age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure in mmHg (millimeters of mercury), cholsterol levels in mg/dl (milligrams per deciliter), whether the paitent's fasting blood sugar is above 120 mg/dl, type of resting electrocardiographic results, patient's maximum heart rate (bpm), whether exercise induced chest pain in a patient, the ST depression induced by exercise, the slope of the ST segement at peak excercise, the amount of blood vessels analyzed for a patient, whether the patient has Thalassemia (blood disorder) and finally the heart disease diagnosis.\n"

    "Such findings could have several impacts. Firstly, they would contribute to a better understanding of the risk factors associated with heart disease. This knowledge could lead to improved preventive measures and screening protocols, enabling healthcare professionals to identify individuals at higher risk and provide targeted interventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, these findings could influence public health policies and initiatives aimed at reducing the prevalence of heart disease. Governments and health organizations might prioritize campaigns promoting healthy lifestyle choices, such as regular exercise, balanced diets, and encourage individuals to reduce intake of cholesterol in the diet, to mitigate the risk factors identified in the study.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, these findings could also have implications for individual behavior. People who are aware of the correlation between high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol levels, and heart disease may be more motivated to proactively manage their health. They might adopt healthier habits, seek medical advice, and adhere to treatment plans to lower their risk of developing heart disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the impact of such findings range from informing medical practice and shaping public health strategies to empowering individuals to take proactive measures for their cardiovascular health."

    "One question that could arise from these findings is whether there are any other factors apart from blood pressure and blood cholersterol level that contribute to an increased risk of developing heart disease. It is recommended to develop improved risk assessment models that incorporate blood pressure, blood cholesterol levels, and other relevant factors could help in accurately predicting an individual's risk of heart disease. This could assist in targeted interventions, early detection, and personalized treatment plans."
